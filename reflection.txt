Approach:
1. First I read all the instruction/tasks that are mentioned in the GDGoC PSIT task list.
2. After all I use that element that are mentioned in the task list one by one.
3. And in this way I cleared all the task one by one and that's it.

Challenges:
~ I only occured the line challenge that <a> tag is not covering all line it only take only that space which is needed for that, So for this I used <br/> tags which helps me to create new line for my new anchor tag this helps me to make the website more user-friendly.

Learning:
~ As I already familier with HTML but still it more helps me as form of task or we can say that small project.
